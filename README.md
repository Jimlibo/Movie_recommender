# Movie_recommender
The project is a simple movie recommender system with prolog and python. First, using prolog
a base of knowledge is created and some rules are added. The system recommends movies by consulting 
the base of knowledge.

File db.pl contains most of the rules used in the recommendation process.

Movies_metadata.csv is the file from which the base of knowledge is created, while the rest .csv files are used for training and testing
