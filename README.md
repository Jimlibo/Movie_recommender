# Movie_recommender
The project is a simple movie recommender system with prolog and python. First, using prolog
a base of knowledge is created and some rules are added. The system recommends movies by consulting 
the base of knowledge.

There is also a file that explores the csv that is used for the above, just so we can have a better
understanding of it.
